# Watercolor Simulation Painting Tool

This project is a digital painting tool focused on simulating the unique behavior of watercolor.  
It is being developed using the [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org/).

## Goals
- Realistic watercolor brush dynamics
- Artist-friendly interface and tools
- Web-ready performance

## Status
Getting familiar with Godot engine.
Implementing physics simulation for watercolor behavior in trial3

## Next Steps
- Refine watercolor physics simulation
- Implement brush engine and UI tools
- Implement various input range from brush(pressure, stroke speed)
- Optimize for web performance

## Trial Descriptions
- **`trial1`**: Focused on learning the basics of the Godot engine.
- **`trial2`**: Introduced a more robust data structure to support future expansion.
- **`trial3`**: Improved data structure for faster simulation and easier feature expansion.
